PRESENT cipher Arduino sketch
=============================

An Arduino sketch running my [size-optimized assembly implementation](https://github.com/aczid/ru_crypto_engineering) of the [PRESENT cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRESENT_%28cipher%29).
Made for use with [Ino](http://inotool.org/).
Ino requires a patch to support .S files, which is included, after which you can run:

    ino build
    ino upload
